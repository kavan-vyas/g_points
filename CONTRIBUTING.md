   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Areas where we need help:
- **Physics improvements**: Making the gravity simulation more realistic
- **Performance optimization**: Better handling of large numbers of particles
- **UI enhancements**: Improving the controls and interface in `egpoints.py`
- **Visual effects**: Adding new particle effects, trails, or animations
- **Code cleanup**: Refactoring and organizing the codebase


## Code Style

- Keep the code simple and readable
- Add comments for complex physics calculations
- Follow Python naming conventions
- Test your changes on both versions if applicable
